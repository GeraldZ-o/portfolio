**“Blast rocks, steal loot, and rock the cosmos — one asteroid at a time.”** - ChatGPT (Banger Quote btw)

Space is full of rocks. You’ve got rockets.

You do the math.

Join the Rock-It Raiders, an outlaw crew of cosmic demolition experts blasting asteroids (and anyone dumb enough to get in the way). Upgrade your ship, snag ridiculous powerups, and turn the galaxy into your personal fireworks show.
